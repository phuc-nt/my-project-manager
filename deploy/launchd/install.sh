# Install the launchd jobs for this repo, substituting the real clone path into the
# plist templates (which ship with a __REPO_DIR__ placeholder so the repo can live
# anywhere). Run once after cloning; re-run safely after pulling new plist templates.
#
# Usage:
#   ./deploy/launchd/install.sh              # install the coordinating service (v2, recommended)
#   ./deploy/launchd/install.sh --legacy     # install the 3 single-agent cron jobs instead (v1 path)
#
# The service (com.mpm.service) reads registry.yaml + each profile's cron schedule and
# spawns per-agent workers. The legacy jobs call run-report.sh on a fixed clock for the
# single `default` agent. Do NOT run both — they double-schedule. See run-report.sh header.
