# Getting Started — Add a New Agent & Project

> Register a PM agent for a new Jira project, GitHub repo, and Slack channel. Takes 10 minutes.
> **New in M7**: You can now create agents via the web UI (non-technical). See §Web UI below. Otherwise, follow the CLI steps.
> Back to [v2 README](README.md).

---

## One-command install (recommended)

On macOS, `deploy/install.sh` does the whole setup in one shot and is safe to re-run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/phuc-nt/my-project-manager.git
cd my-project-manager
./deploy/install.sh
```

It runs a **preflight** (fails loud with the exact `brew install …` if `uv`/`node`/`git`/`gh` is
missing), `uv sync`, builds the SPA into a temp dir and swaps it in atomically, clones + builds the
3 MCP servers over **HTTPS** into `~/workspace/` (set `MCP_BASE=<dir>` to relocate — the script then
writes the matching `*_MCP_DIST` into `.env`), installs the launchd services, and prints a **health
gate** (MCP builds, `gh auth`, dashboard-auth) before declaring success.

Re-running when nothing changed is a **no-op**: it does not restart the coordinator (which would
kill in-flight agent runs) or the web service (which would drop sessions) — it reloads a service
only when its plist or the SPA build actually changed. Secrets never pass through the script: you
fill them in the browser Setup Wizard, and the post-login **Cài đặt → Sức khỏe hệ thống** panel
shows what's still missing with a copy-paste fix command per check.

`gh auth login` is interactive and can't be scripted — the preflight/health gate flags it if not
yet done. The manual steps below remain valid if you prefer to run each piece yourself.

---

## Web UI Method (New in M7)

If you have the web dashboard running on localhost, you can create agents without touching the terminal:

1. Open http://localhost:8765/create
2. **Step 1**: Select your domain (pm, hr, or custom)
3. **Step 2**: Enter agent ID and name; optionally fill persona
4. **Step 3**: Choose report kinds and build a cron schedule
5. **Step 4**: Fill bindings (Jira project, GitHub repo, Slack channel, Confluence space)
6. **Step 5**: Review and get a `.env` template to copy-paste to your technical operator

The wizard validates everything before saving. On completion, the agent appears in the Team view.

> **Ask-agent (M11):** add an `inbox:` block to the agent's profile.yaml (`channel: <internal channel ID>`, `poll_minutes: N`) and the running service will answer `@<agent-id>` mentions in that channel with real data, in a thread. Internal channels only; every reply goes through the Action Gateway.

> **Chat-command (M12):** if the agent's pack ships a command catalog (pm: `create_issue`), a mention like "tạo ticket: …" is queued for HUMAN approval (never executed directly); approve it at /approvals or `mpm agent approve <id> <n>` and the action runs for real.

> **Telegram identity (M13):** each agent can have its OWN Telegram bot (own name + avatar — a real separate identity, unlike the shared Slack browser account). See §Telegram bot per agent below.

---

## Telegram Bot per Agent (New in M13)

Give an agent its own Telegram identity in ~5 minutes. Through its bot the agent (1) answers questions with real data (like M11), (2) takes commands that queue for your approval (like M12), and (3) delivers its scheduled reports as messages.

### 1. Create the bot (BotFather)

1. In Telegram, open **@BotFather** → send `/newbot`.
2. Name it after the agent (e.g. `Acme PM Agent`), pick a username (e.g. `acme_pm_bot`).
3. Copy the token BotFather returns (`123456:ABC-...`).
4. Optional but recommended: `/setuserpic` to give the agent a face, `/setdescription` for its role.
5. **If the bot will sit in a GROUP** (not just DMs): send BotFather `/setprivacy` → select the bot → **Disable**. New bots ship with privacy mode ON, which hides ordinary group messages from the bot — with it on, `@<agent-id>` mentions in a group NEVER reach the agent and the feature silently does nothing. If the bot was already in the group before you disabled privacy, **remove it and re-add it** (Telegram caches the old setting per group). DMs are unaffected either way.

### 2. Get your chat id

Message your new bot once (anything), then run:

```bash
curl -s "https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates" | python3 -m json.tool | grep -A1 '"chat"'
```

The `"id"` number is your chat id (a DM id is positive; a group id is negative).

### 3. Wire it into the profile

`.env` (the token value NEVER goes in profile.yaml):

```bash
ACME_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456:ABC-...
```

`profiles/acme-web/profile.yaml`:

```yaml
telegram:
  bot_token_env: ACME_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
  chat_ids: ["123456789"]      # DM and/or group ids the bot may talk in — an allowlist
  poll_minutes: 2
```

`chat_ids` is enforced BOTH ways: messages from any other chat are ignored, and the bot refuses to send anywhere else — even if dragged into a stranger's group, it can neither read nor speak there.

### 4. Use it

- **DM the bot** → every message is answered (no @mention needed).
- **In a group** → address it with `@<agent-id>` (e.g. `@acme-web tiến độ sao rồi?`).
- **Commands** (pm pack): "tạo ticket giúp mình: …" → the bot replies "⏳ chờ duyệt #N" — nothing happens until you approve at /approvals or `mpm agent approve <id> <N>`.
- **Reports**: while the coordinating service runs, scheduled reports for the **pm-pack kinds** (daily/weekly/okr/resource) are ALSO sent to every allowlisted chat — internal audience only. (hr/admin pack graphs don't wire extra channels yet, same as email.)

Every outbound message passes the Action Gateway (audit, dry-run, dedup, kill switch) exactly like Slack posts.

---

## CLI Method (Traditional)

### Part 1: Register the Agent

The registration command scaffolds a new agent directory from the default template and adds it to the registry.

```bash
uv run python -m src.entrypoints.mpm agent register <agent-id>
```

Example: register an agent named `acme-web` for the ACME Web Platform project.

```bash
uv run python -m src.entrypoints.mpm agent register acme-web
```

This creates:

```
profiles/acme-web/
├── profile.yaml       ← config: bindings, thresholds, budget, schedule
├── SOUL.md            ← persona/tone (empty by default)
├── PROJECT.md         ← team context (empty by default)
└── MEMORY.md          ← agent-maintained memory (always empty at start)
```

And adds to `registry.yaml`:

```yaml
agents:
  - id: acme-web
    enabled: true
```

---

## Part 2: Fill the Profile

Open `profiles/acme-web/profile.yaml` and fill the **5 required fields**:

| Field | Example | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `bindings.jira.project_key` | `ACME` | Jira project key (uppercase, visible in Jira URL: `jira.example.com/browse/ACME-123`) |
| `bindings.github.repo` | `acme/web-platform` | GitHub owner/repo (used by `gh` CLI) |
| `bindings.slack.report_channel` | `#acme-standup` | Where the daily report posts |
| `bindings.slack.token_env` | `ACME_SLACK_XOXC_TOKEN` | Name of env var holding the Slack token (value goes in `.env`, not here) |
| `bindings.confluence.space_key` | `ACME` | Confluence space key (where reports are archived) |

**Minimal working example:**

```yaml
id: acme-web
name: "ACME Web Platform"
enabled: true

bindings:
  jira:
    project_key: ACME
    token_env: ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN
  github:
    repo: acme/web-platform
  slack:
    report_channel: "#acme-standup"
    token_env: SLACK_XOXC_TOKEN
  confluence:
    space_key: ACME
    token_env: ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN

# All defaults below — tune later if needed
model: minimax/minimax-m2.7
budget:
  monthly_usd: 50
  warn_ratio: 0.8
safety:
  dry_run: true          # ← DRY_RUN by default (logs, posts nothing)
  write_disabled: false
thresholds:
  pr_stale_days: 7
  blocker_label_substring: block
  okr_behind_threshold: 0.5
  resource_overload_ratio: 1.5
  labor_cost_per_issue: 0
schedule: {}
reports: []
```

### Optional: Add Persona & Context

**`profiles/acme-web/SOUL.md`** — your agent's tone:

```markdown
# Persona — ACME Web Platform

You are the PM agent for the ACME Web Platform team. Be direct and action-focused.
When reporting to stakeholders (external audience), remove all developer jargon and issue keys.
```

**`profiles/acme-web/PROJECT.md`** — team facts the agent should know:

```markdown
# ACME Web Platform — Project Context

- Team: 6 engineers, 1 Scrum Master.
- Release schedule: quarterly (next: Q3 2026-09-30).
- Label convention: "p0" or "critical" = blocker.
- Known risk: review bottleneck on backend PRs (reviewer @minh-le is often blocked).
```

Both are optional — leave them empty if you prefer defaults. The agent reads them fresh on every run.

---

## Part 3: Add Secrets to `.env`

The `token_env` fields in `profile.yaml` are names. The actual tokens go in `.env` (gitignored).

```bash
cp config.example.env .env  # if not already done
```

Then add:

```bash
# For acme-web agent (using Slack XOXC token)
SLACK_XOXC_TOKEN=xoxc-...
SLACK_XOXD_TOKEN=xoxd-...
ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN=ATATT...

# Global: required for all agents
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
ATLASSIAN_SITE_NAME=acme.atlassian.net
ATLASSIAN_USER_EMAIL=you@acme.com
SLACK_TEAM_DOMAIN=acme.slack.com

# GitHub: auth via `gh` CLI (not in .env)
# Run: gh auth login
```

**Never commit `.env`** — it's in `.gitignore`.

---

## Part 4: Test (Dry Run)

The `dry_run: true` default means "log what the agent WOULD do, post nothing."

```bash
uv run python -m src.entrypoints.mpm agent run acme-web --report daily
```

Output logs to console (no Slack post, no Confluence write). Inspect the logs to verify:

- ✅ Jira connection OK (issues listed)
- ✅ GitHub connection OK (PRs listed)
- ✅ Slack & Confluence connections OK (channels found)

### Troubleshoot failures at this stage using the FAQ below.

---

## Part 5: Enable Live Mode & Schedule (Optional)

Once dry run succeeds:

### Enable posting:

```bash
# One-time test — posts to Slack/Confluence for real
DRY_RUN=false uv run python -m src.entrypoints.mpm agent run acme-web --report daily
```

Then flip it in `profile.yaml`:

```yaml
safety:
  dry_run: false    # ← Now live
```

### Schedule it:

Uncomment in `profile.yaml`:

```yaml
schedule:
  daily: "0 9 * * *"      # 09:00 every day
  weekly: "0 17 * * 5"    # 17:00 Fridays
```

Install the coordinating service (runs agents on schedule):

```bash
./deploy/launchd/install.sh
```

Check logs:

```bash
tail -f .data/cron-acme-web.log
```

---

## Part 6: Manage Approvals (Lớp B)

Certain writes (closing a PR, reassigning a person, posting to a stakeholder channel) require human approval first.

List pending approvals for an agent:

```bash
uv run python -m src.entrypoints.mpm agent approvals acme-web
```

Sample output:

```
ID                 | Type             | Status   | Created
approval-123-abc   | close_pr         | pending  | 2026-06-28 09:30
approval-124-def   | post_external    | pending  | 2026-06-28 09:31
```

Approve or reject:

```bash
# Approve
uv run python -m src.entrypoints.mpm agent approve acme-web approval-123-abc

# Reject
uv run python -m src.entrypoints.mpm agent reject acme-web approval-123-abc
```

For a web-based approval UI, see the web dashboard (M2 feature).

## FAQ & Troubleshooting

### MCP server spawn fails / "command not found"

**Symptom:** Error like `spawn ENOENT` or `cannot find jira-mcp-server`.

**Cause:** The 3 external MCP servers (Jira, Confluence, Slack) are separate repos you must clone and build.

**Fix:**

```bash
# HTTPS clone (matches deploy/install.sh — no SSH key needed)
cd ~/workspace
for repo in jira-cloud-mcp-server confluence-cloud-mcp-server slack-browser-mcp-server; do
  git clone https://github.com/phuc-nt/$repo.git
  (cd $repo && npm install && npm run build)
done
```

If you cloned them to a different path, set env vars in `.env`:

```bash
JIRA_MCP_DIST=~/my-servers/jira-cloud-mcp-server/dist/index.js
CONFLUENCE_MCP_DIST=~/my-servers/confluence-cloud-mcp-server/dist/index.js
SLACK_MCP_DIST=~/my-servers/slack-browser-mcp-server/dist/index.js
```

---

### GitHub calls fail / "not authorized"

**Symptom:** `GraphQL error: Unauthorized` or `gh: authentication required`.

**Cause:** GitHub auth via the `gh` CLI (not a token in `.env`). You must log in first.

**Fix:**

```bash
gh auth login
# Select: GitHub.com, HTTPS, Paste PAT or use browser login, scoped (read repo + PR + commit)
gh auth status  # verify
```

The agent reads your logged-in credentials automatically.

---

### Slack: "channel not found" or report not posted

**Symptom:** Slack post fails with `channel_not_found` or report never appears.

**Cause:** 
1. Channel name vs ID mismatch (profile uses `#acme-standup` but Slack internal ID is `C0123456`)
2. Agent lacks permission to post (token expired or not in channel)
3. Report queued for approval (Lớp B) — won't auto-post to stakeholder channels

**Fix:**

1. **Use channel ID instead of name** (more reliable):

   ```bash
   # In Slack, open the channel → Details → copy the ID (C0123XXXXX)
   ```

   Update `profile.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   slack:
     report_channel: "C0123XXXXX"    # ← ID, not name
   ```

2. **Verify token has channel access:**

   ```bash
   uv run python -m src.entrypoints.mpm agent run acme-web --report daily
   # Check logs for "channel_not_found" errors
   ```

3. **For stakeholder channels:** If the report is for an external audience, it goes to Lớp B approval:

   ```bash
   uv run python -m src.entrypoints.mpm agent approvals acme-web
   # Approve the pending `post_external` action
   ```

---

### "Nothing posted at all" / report silent

**Symptom:** Dry run logs mention "Would post to Slack" but nothing appears. No errors.

**Cause:** `dry_run: true` (the safe default) means the agent logs but does NOT post.

**Fix:**

Verify `profile.yaml`:

```yaml
safety:
  dry_run: false    # ← Change from true
```

Or run with the flag:

```bash
DRY_RUN=false uv run python -m src.entrypoints.mpm agent run acme-web --report daily
```

---

### Budget hard-stop reached / agent stopped writing

**Symptom:** Error like `monthly_budget_usd exceeded (cost: $52 > budget: $50)`.

**Cause:** The agent tracks OpenRouter API spend. Cost hit the month's limit.

**Fix:**

1. Wait for the calendar month boundary (resets automatically), OR
2. Increase the cap in `profile.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   budget:
     monthly_usd: 100    # ← raise the limit
   ```

3. Check spend:

   ```bash
   uv run python -m src.entrypoints.mpm agent audit acme-web --cost
   ```

---

### External report never appears / "stuck in Lớp B queue"

**Symptom:** You ran `--audience external` but the report never posts to the stakeholder channel.

**Cause:** External posts (to executives, investors, or public channels) are queued for human review first (Lớp B approval). This is by design — no autonomous post to sensitive audiences.

**Fix:**

The report is **not** lost; it's waiting. Check approvals:

```bash
uv run python -m src.entrypoints.mpm agent approvals acme-web
```

Approve it:

```bash
uv run python -m src.entrypoints.mpm agent approve acme-web <approval_id>
```

Then the agent posts to Slack + Confluence.

---

### launchd job not firing / scheduled report didn't run

**Symptom:** Scheduled time passed but `.data/cron-acme-web.log` is empty.

**Cause:** 
1. `install.sh` wasn't run (manual symlink of .plist doesn't work reliably)
2. Machine was asleep (launchd only fires when awake)
3. The schedule cron expression is wrong

**Fix:**

1. **Ensure install.sh was run:**

   ```bash
   ./deploy/launchd/install.sh
   # Checks: ~/.config/launchd/my-project-manager-coordinator.plist exists
   ```

2. **Check logs:**

   ```bash
   tail -f .data/cron-acme-web.log
   # If empty or old, the job hasn't fired
   ```

3. **Manual trigger (test):**

   ```bash
   launchctl start my.project-manager.coordinator
   # Then check logs again
   ```

4. **Validate the cron expression:**

   ```yaml
   schedule:
     daily: "0 9 * * *"   # ← 09:00 UTC daily (verify TZ if needed)
   ```

   Test locally:

   ```bash
   DRY_RUN=false uv run python -m src.entrypoints.mpm agent run acme-web --report daily
   ```

---

### Agent crashes with "import error" or "module not found"

**Symptom:** Error like `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src.actions'`.

**Cause:** Dependencies not synced or Python version mismatch (repo requires Python 3.12).

**Fix:**

```bash
# Re-sync dependencies
uv sync

# Verify Python version
python --version   # should be 3.12.x

# If using system Python, force 3.12
uv python install 3.12
uv sync
```

---

### Confluence page not created / OKR section blank

**Symptom:** Jira/GitHub data posts to Slack OK, but Confluence page is empty or missing OKR section.

**Cause:**
1. `space_key` is wrong
2. `okr_page_id` not set (OKR only if you link a Confluence page with an OKR table)
3. Confluence token lacks write permission

**Fix:**

1. **Verify space key:**

   ```bash
   # In Confluence, go to Space → Space settings → get the "Space key"
   ```

   Update `profile.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   confluence:
     space_key: ACME     # ← correct key
   ```

2. **Link OKR page (optional):**

   If you have a Confluence page with an OKR tracking table, get its page ID and add:

   ```yaml
   confluence:
     okr_page_id: "557057"    # ← page ID (visible in URL: ...pages/557057/...)
   ```

3. **Check token scope:**

   Atlassian token must have write access to the space. Regenerate if needed (id.atlassian.com → Security → API tokens).

---

### Performance: report takes too long

**Symptom:** Daily report takes >30 seconds; agent seems slow.

**Cause:** 
1. Large Jira project (1000s of issues) — analyzer fetches all
2. Network latency to Slack/Confluence API
3. LLM latency (depends on OpenRouter queue)

**Fix:**

1. **Filter Jira in PROJECT.md:**

   ```markdown
   # Focus on backlog only (not closed issues)
   Analyzer filter: JQL = status != Done AND sprint = ACME-Current
   ```

2. **Check cost/latency with audit:**

   ```bash
   uv run python -m src.entrypoints.mpm agent audit acme-web --timing
   ```

3. **Adjust thresholds to reduce LLM context:**

   ```yaml
   thresholds:
     pr_stale_days: 10      # ← less strict = fewer PRs to analyze
   ```

---

### "Dry run showed stale PRs but doesn't mention my specific PR"

**Symptom:** You know a PR is stale, but the agent's daily report doesn't list it.

**Cause:** 
1. PR state changed since agent ran (merged/closed)
2. PR is in a draft state (agent filters drafts)
3. `pr_stale_days` threshold is higher than the PR's age

**Fix:**

Check manually in the logs:

```bash
# Re-run with DEBUG=true
DEBUG=true uv run python -m src.entrypoints.mpm agent run acme-web --report daily 2>&1 | grep "PR\|stale"
```

Adjust threshold:

```yaml
thresholds:
  pr_stale_days: 3    # ← lower threshold (flag PRs older than 3 days)
```

---
