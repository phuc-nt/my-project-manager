"""_template-pack graphs (v20 authoring skeleton).

`REPORT_KINDS` maps each report kind to a uniform builder the core dispatches. This template
reuses the core `build_report_graph` for its one `example` kind so the skeleton runs out of the
box; a real pack replaces the builder body with its own perceive→analyze→compose→deliver graph
(see hr-pack/graphs.py for a domain that supplies a NEW analyzer + ToolProvider).

The builder signature is fixed — the core calls every kind the same way:
    build(checkpointer, *, config, settings, context, audience, store, remember, tools=None)
