"""pm-pack write surface (v3 M5 S4): allowlist contribution + write handlers.

The PM domain contributes its `ALLOWLIST` — the MCP server→tool names PM may write to.
The gateway threads this into `classify(..., allowlist=...)` as the default-DENY surface.
It is identical to the core's pre-v3 default, so PM behavior is byte-identical. A pack can
only *add* permitted tools here; it can NEVER widen the Lớp A red line (destructive/
security markers stay in core `hard_block.py`, are checked first, and are not
pack-overridable).

Write-handler DISPATCH stays in core (`src/actions/approved_dispatch.py`): the handlers
(slack/confluence/linear/email) are shared gateway primitives reused across domains (M6's
HR pack posts to Slack too), so the pack does not own handler callables — it only
declares the allowlist. A domain-specific handler, if ever needed, is added then (YAGNI).
