"""Action Gateway — the single authorized path for every mutation (PDR §7, §5).

No module may call a write API (MCP write tool, `gh` mutating command) directly.
Everything goes through `ActionGateway.execute()`, which runs this chain:

    Lớp A hard-deny -> Lớp B interrupt (queue for approval) -> deny-if-blocked
        -> kill-switch -> dry-run -> rate-limit -> idempotency -> execute -> audit

Each stage can short-circuit. Every outcome is audited. This is the invariant
that makes "full autonomous write" safe: autonomous in speed, never in
accountability.

Lớp B (sensitive-but-reversible: merge/close PR, close/transition/assign issue)
is queued via the approval store and only run later through `approve()` — never
auto-executed. Lớp A (data-loss/credential/security) is never overridable, even
by `approve()`.
