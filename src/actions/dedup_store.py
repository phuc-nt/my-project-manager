"""Persistent idempotency store (PDR §7.6).

The Action Gateway must not re-execute an action it already ran — even across
process restarts (a daily cron re-run must not double-post). Phase 0 kept seen
keys in an in-memory set, which re-armed on restart; this backs them with SQLite
under the data dir so dedup survives restarts.

Single-user / local: a SQLite file with a UNIQUE key column is enough. The
INSERT-OR-IGNORE pattern makes "claim this key" atomic.
