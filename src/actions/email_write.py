"""Email WRITE — send a report email via the Action Gateway (M3-P11 D2).

Outbound email is a MUTATION, so it MUST go through `ActionGateway.execute`, never call
`smtplib` directly outside the handler. The gateway applies the `email_send` Lớp A scan,
the Lớp B human-approval queue (ALL email is Lớp B — locked policy), kill-switch, dry-run,
rate-limit, idempotency, and audit. This module supplies the handler + a wrapper.

stdlib only (`smtplib` + `email.message.EmailMessage`, STARTTLS) — no new dependency. The
SMTP password is read from `os.environ["SMTP_PASSWORD"]` inside the handler at send time, so
it never lives on the action dict (it would otherwise enter the audit log / approval store).
