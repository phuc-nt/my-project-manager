"""Jira write handler — execute an APPROVED Jira MCP action (v5 M12).

Jira writes were allowlisted (createIssue/addComment) since v1 but nothing ever
dispatched them — reports only read Jira. Chat-commands make them real: an approved
`{server: "jira", tool, args}` action routes here. Same shape as the Slack/Linear
handlers: the token-bearing server spec stays in the closure (injected from config at
dispatch time), never on the persisted action. This module is only ever invoked by
`approve()` — after Lớp A + allowlist + a HUMAN said yes.
