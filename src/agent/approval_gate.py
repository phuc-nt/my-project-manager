"""Lớp B graph-native interrupt — the `approval_gate` node (v2 M2-P5).

A pure node placed BETWEEN `compose_report` and `deliver` in every report graph.
For `audience="external"` it calls LangGraph `interrupt()` so the graph PAUSES
before any delivery, checkpoint-serializes its state, and resumes deterministically
via `Command(resume="approve"|"reject")`. Approve routes to `deliver`; reject routes
to `END` (clean stop, nothing posted). For `audience="internal"` the node is a
pass-through and the graph runs straight through, so existing internal behavior is
unchanged.

This AUGMENTS the gateway queue path (`pending_approval` + `ApprovalStore` +
`cli/mpm approve`) — it does not replace it. The one-shot worker subprocess that
cannot hold a live graph still uses the queue; the interrupt path is for an
in-process / resume-capable run (worker `--resume`).

Red lines preserved:
- The node is PURE: it only calls `interrupt()` and returns the decision into state.
  ALL side effects stay in `deliver`, which runs ONCE after an approve — so a node
  re-run on resume is harmless.
- The interrupt payload carries ONLY a non-PII action summary (report kind +
  stakeholder channel + title). No persona/project/memory ever enters it.
