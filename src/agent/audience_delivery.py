"""Audience-aware delivery routing — channel + dedup hint per audience.

Phase 5: the 3 report graphs all need the same rule to pick the Slack channel and
dedup namespace for `internal` vs `external` delivery. Factored here so the rule
(and the fail-fast guard) lives in one place.

- internal → channel None (the default `slack_report_channel`), dedup hint
  `{kind}-{today}` UNCHANGED (backward-compat).
- external → channel = `slack_stakeholder_channel` (must be set, else raise — never
  silently fall back to the internal channel), dedup hint `{kind}-external-{today}`.

The external channel is (by the Slice-A config validation) in
`slack_external_channels`, so `hard_block.needs_interrupt` routes the post to Lớp B
approval — no gateway/allowlist change needed.
