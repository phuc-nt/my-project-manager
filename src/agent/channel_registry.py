"""Delivery channel registry (M3-P11 D2) — additive multi-channel report delivery.

Today reports always go to Slack + Confluence (in each graph's `_deliver`). This registry
adds OPTIONAL extra channels (currently Email) without changing that core path: when an
`smtp` config is present, the report is ALSO emailed. Every extra-channel send is a
mutation routed through the Action Gateway (Email = `email_send`, all Lớp B), so dry-run /
kill-switch / approval / audit apply automatically.

Backward-compat: no `smtp` config ⇒ `resolve_channels` returns () ⇒ delivery is byte-identical
to pre-P11 (Slack + Confluence only).
