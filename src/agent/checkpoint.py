"""Checkpointer for the LangGraph agent (system-architecture.md §3, §5).

Provides resume + time-travel debug + an audit-friendly state trail. SQLite is the
DEFAULT (local-first, a single per-agent file, no infra dependency). Postgres is an
opt-in scale-up (M2-P8) for durable state across processes/machines, selected by
`settings.checkpointer == "postgres"` + a `postgres_dsn`.

Both savers are returned OPEN: `from_conn_string` is a context manager, so for a
long-lived CLI/worker/server process we open the underlying connection directly and
let the saver live for the process lifetime.
