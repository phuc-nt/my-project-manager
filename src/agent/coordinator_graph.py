"""Coordinator ticker (v12 M28b): one SHORT tick, one action, exit.

Runs on the coordinator agent (`company.yaml::coordinator_id`) as the `team-tick`
generic pseudo-kind (mirrors `tasks`/`ops-alerts`) — NOT a long-running process. Every
tick: pick ONE open team task, take ONE action on it, return. No 600s-worker-kill risk
because a tick never blocks on a spawned worker (it spawns DETACHED and moves on).

Tick actions, in priority order for a given task:
  1. A step is `pending` with all deps `done` -> reserve the lease + spawn a DETACHED
     `team-step` worker (do not wait for it).
  2. A step is `running` -> poll it: dead pid + no outcome artifact -> retry once, then
     `failed`; lease expired -> kill the pid, mark `timeout`, escalate to Telegram.
  3. A step is `awaiting_approval` WITH an `approval_id` (the gateway queued its
     external write in `ApprovalStore`) -> poll that approval: `approved` ->
     re-reserve + re-spawn the SAME step (there is no LangGraph checkpointer on this
     graph — resuming means re-running perceive/work/deliver from scratch, and
     `deliver`'s external write is gateway-dedup-idempotent against the earlier
     attempt, see `team_task_graph.py`'s module docstring); `rejected` -> mark the
     step `failed` + escalate; still `pending` (no decision yet) -> leave it, exactly
     like an `awaiting_approval` step with NO `approval_id` (e.g. a test double, or a
     gate this ticker never learned an id for) — the lease clock is considered PAUSED
     for `awaiting_approval` by construction; only `running` steps are ever polled for
     lease expiry (see `coordinator_nodes.tick_actions.poll_running_step`), never an
     `awaiting_approval` one, approval-decided-or-not.
  4. All steps `done` -> aggregate (one LLM summarize call) -> deliver a room payload,
     mark the task `done`, record the aggregate cost.
  5. Cost cap exceeded (step + decompose + aggregate) -> stop the task, mark `stalled`,
     escalate.
  6. No ready/running/awaiting step AND not all-done, but at least one step is
     terminally `failed`/`timeout` (retries exhausted, approval rejected, lease
     timeout) -> the task can never complete as planned: mark `stalled`, escalate
     exactly once (the status transition itself removes the task from
     `list_dispatchable()`, so no later tick re-enters this branch for it).

Before any of the above: the persisted DAG's content hash is re-verified against the
task's `plan_hash` on every tick (`_verify_plan_hash`) — a mismatch stalls the task +
escalates instead of ever dispatching a step from an unverified plan (this is a fast,
idempotent no-op comparison in the normal case; steps never legitimately change once
`confirm_plan` flips a task out of `planning`).

Reboot recovery is free: there is no separate "resume" trigger — the next tick simply
re-reads `team_task_store` and continues from whatever it sees (a `running` step with a
dead pid is caught by action 2 on the very next tick).

Retry counting has no column in the P2 store schema (only `escalated_at` at the task
level), so `RetryTracker` is an injectable small counter this module owns (the real
one is a JSON sidecar file, see `team_tick_runner.py`).
