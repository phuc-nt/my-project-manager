"""Peer-review/rework insert rule for the coordinator ticker (M32) — split out of
`tick_actions.py` to keep that module under the repo's ~200 LOC guideline (this rule
is also a genuinely separate concern: it decides WHAT dynamic rows to mint, `tick_actions`
decides WHICH step to poll/dispatch next).

Called from `coordinator_graph._act_on_task`, once per tick, BEFORE the normal
ready/poll/aggregate dispatch decisions — a `done` content/review/rework step is
inspected exactly once per tick for whether it needs a follow-up row minted. This is a
TICKER RULE: every decision here is plain Python over store columns, never an LLM call
— the review verdict (an LLM call) already happened inside the review-step's own worker
run (`review_graph.run_review_step`); this module only reacts to its STORED verdict.

Three sub-rules, each independently idempotent (checked via "does a child row already
exist" before minting one) so re-running this on the SAME already-handled step across
multiple ticks is always a safe no-op:

  1. A `work` step (`needs_review=True`) reaches `done` with no review-step child yet
     -> mint one (`pick_reviewer`; `None` -> skip + room event, never stall).
  2. A `review` step reaches `done` -> read its verdict artifact:
       - `passed` -> nothing to do, the DAG's normal `next_pending_step`/aggregate path
         takes it from here (the review step itself has no downstream dep in the
         confirmed DAG, so no other step is unblocked by it directly — it exists only
         to gate whether a rework is needed).
       - "needs_rework" AND `review_round < MAX_REVIEW_ROUNDS` -> mint a rework-step
         (same original author, carries prior output + failures).
       - "needs_rework" AND `review_round >= MAX_REVIEW_ROUNDS` -> EXPLICIT stall +
         escalate (v12's `_dead_end_result` cannot see this: every step here is `done`,
         never `failed`/`timeout`).
       - verdict artifact missing/stale (`stale_artifact`, the reviewed content re-ran
         since this review was queued) -> mint a FRESH review-step (round unchanged) so
         a new reviewer run grades the CURRENT artifact instead of leaving the task stuck
         on a review that graded content nobody will ever see delivered.
  3. A `rework` step reaches `done` -> mint a NEW review-step for it (`review_round + 1`)
     — the rework's own freshly-written artifact becomes the next round's locked target.
