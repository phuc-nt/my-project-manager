"""Minimal LangGraph agent (Phase 0): perceive -> respond.

Proves the graph lifecycle (CLI -> graph -> 1 LLM call -> output) with a SQLite
checkpointer wired in. The full perceive -> analyze -> decide -> compose_report
-> deliver flow (system-architecture.md §3) is Phase 1; Phase 0 keeps it to an
LLM echo so the wiring is verifiable end to end.

`build_graph` accepts an optional LlmClient so the graph can be built and
compiled without a key (the client is only constructed/called inside the node).
