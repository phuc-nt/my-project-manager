"""The `remember` graph node — extract + persist agent memory (v2 M2-P8 Slice 3).

Runs AFTER `deliver` on the INTERNAL report graphs. On a real internal delivery it:
1. extracts salient facts from the report (injectable extractor — LLM by default),
2. writes each fact to the LangGraph Store under `(agent_id, "memory")` keyed by a
   content hash (identical facts across runs dedupe), and
3. mirrors the facts into MEMORY.md's agent section (human-visible + the read path for
   the next run, via the existing P2 injection).

Gated: writes NOTHING unless the run actually delivered AND is internal AND not a
dry-run — there is nothing to remember from a skipped/dry/external report. This is
INTERNAL agent state: it does NOT go through the Action Gateway (the gateway governs
EXTERNAL mutations only). The node never imports ActionGateway.
