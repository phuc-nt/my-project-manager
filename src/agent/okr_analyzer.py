"""OKR analyzer — roll up Objective/KR progress from parsed rows + epic progress.

Pure and deterministic (no network, no clock), mirroring `risk_analyzer.analyze`:
thresholds are injected, inputs are plain data, outputs are typed. A separate
analyzer (not a new Risk kind) because OKR data is `Objective`/`KeyResult`, not
`Issue`/`PullRequest`/`CiRun` — overloading the risk pipeline would force the
wrong contract.

Resilience: malformed weights, missing epic keys, and unknown epics become
`OkrProblem`s and are excluded from the rollup; the valid rows still roll up so a
bad source row never aborts the report.

Rollup rules (decisions of record, see plan phase-01/phase-02):
- A KR mapped to multiple epics aggregates by CHILD COUNT — Σdone / Σtotal across
  its found epics (not a mean of per-epic percentages), since the running Jira MCP
  has no story points. Falls back to the mean of available `progress_pct` if any
  epic lacks counts.
- An Objective's progress is the WEIGHTED average of its KR progresses using the
  Weight column. If ANY KR weight in an Objective is blank, the whole Objective
  uses equal weighting (KISS — avoids ambiguous mixed math).
- Percentages are 0..100 floats (display rounding happens in the prompt layer).
