"""Handoff-artifact helper for the team-task execution graph (v12 M28a).

Each step writes its output to `data_dir/artifacts/team-tasks/<task-id>/step-<n>.json`
so the NEXT step (possibly on a different agent/process) can read it as its `perceive`
input. Internal-only, no egress, no gateway involvement (THE INVARIANT) — this is a
handoff between graph steps, not a delivery.

Two hazards this module exists to close:
  1. **Path traversal.** `task_id`/`step_seq` must never let a caller escape the
     per-task artifact dir (e.g. a task id like `../../etc`). Every write/read resolves
     the final path and verifies it is still inside the confined root.
  2. **Torn reads.** A reader (the next step, or P3's poller) must never see a
     PARTIAL JSON file mid-write. Writes go to a `.tmp` sibling then `os.replace`
     (atomic on POSIX + Windows NTFS), so a reader either sees the old file, the new
     complete file, or (briefly) nothing — never a half-written one.

    Compares against `unresolved_base` (`data_dir/artifacts/team-tasks`, one level

    would then compare a path against itself and never detect the escape. Anchoring
    one level higher means the per-task dir's OWN symlink-ness is caught too, not
    just symlinks nested inside it.
