"""`ask_colleague`: the M33 consult seam a team-task step's `work` node calls into.

Decision C (red-team 2026-07-10, see `plans/260710-1347-v13-team-self-operation/plan.md`):
consult is a synchronous, read-only "role-play consultation" over a colleague's PUBLIC
persona FILES — `SOUL.md` + `PROJECT.md` (via `src.profile.loader.load_profile`) — NOT
the sibling-memory system (`src.agent.sibling_memory.read_sibling_facts` /
`src.agent.store.get_store`). Two reasons sibling-memory was deliberately dropped, not
merely unused here:

  1. `get_store` defaults to a fresh `InMemoryStore()` per process (`src/agent/store.py`)
     — a team-step worker is a DETACHED subprocess, so any Store read there sees an
     empty store every time on the default backend. Wiring consult through it would be
     dead code dressed as a feature.
  2. `read_sibling_facts` is gated by `project_group` (M3-P9's red line: an agent only
     reads facts from siblings in its OWN project group). A roster-wide "ask any
     colleague" consult has no such scope — routing it through sibling-memory would
     silently WIDEN that red line to the whole fleet, which was never approved.

Reading the two Markdown files directly sidesteps both problems: they are internal-only
BY CONSTRUCTION (never contain external audience content, same guarantee every other
`persona`/`project` injection in this codebase relies on — see `profile.context`), they
always exist (loader returns "" for an absent file, never raises), and touching them
does not "read cross-agent memory" in any sense the red line cares about — it is the
SAME kind of file-read `default_team_task_deps` already does for the ASKING agent's own
persona, just aimed at a colleague's directory instead.

    """Ask `agent_id` (a colleague, never `self_id`) one question; returns `(answer, cost_usd)`.

    Guard (authz, same roster gate `team_task_roster.is_assignable` re-verifies at
    dispatch time): `agent_id` must be in `assignable_staff()` (already excludes the
    coordinator + admin agent) AND must not equal `self_id`. Either guard failing is a
    SKIP, not an error — consult is advisory, never a step-blocking gate. Skip returns
    `("", 0.0)`, identical to the fail-degrade path below, so a caller cannot tell "not
    allowed" from "failed" — both mean "no answer, carry on." No room event is appended
    on a guard-skip (nothing happened worth recording).

    Fail-degrade (profile deleted mid-run, disk error, malformed persona, LLM error,
    anything else): caught here, logged, `("", 0.0)` returned — this function must NEVER
    raise out to the `work` node (mirrors `default_team_task_deps._run_work`'s
    `search_hook` contract, `team_task_graph.py`'s module docstring). A broken consult
    must not burn the step's retry budget or fail delivery.

    RO by construction: only `load_profile` (file read) + one `LlmClient.complete` call
    happen here — no `Store`, no `get_store`, no `sibling_memory` import, no write of any
    kind (see the module docstring for why sibling-memory is deliberately excluded). The
    ONE write this function performs is the room-event append below, and that is a
    template SUMMARY (`_summarize`, ~120 char, first line only) — never the raw SOUL.md/
    PROJECT.md content and never the raw answer text, matching the PII firewall every
    other office-room writer in this codebase honors (`office_event_projection`'s
    write-time allowlist re-enforces the same cap server-side, independent of this
    trim, so a future caller of `append_office_event` that skips this helper still
    cannot leak raw content through the `consult` kind).

    `room_id`/`attempt_id`, when given (the real wiring always passes both — see
    `default_team_task_deps`), append a `consult` room event via
    `office_room_append.append_office_event` (try/degrade — an append failure never
    blocks the answer from reaching the caller). Blank `room_id` (e.g. a bare unit
    test of this function) skips the room append entirely.
