"""Task execution graph: `perceive → work → self_check → (deliver | rework→self_check)`.

Runs ONE step of a team task, on ONE agent, as the `team-step` generic run kind (see
`worker.py`). Per-agent isolation is unchanged — this graph runs inside the SAME
per-agent subprocess/data-dir/gateway every other report graph runs in; the only new
thing is where its input/output come from: not Jira/GitHub, but the team-task handoff
artifact(s) (`team_task_artifact`) written by this step's DEPENDENCIES.

  - `perceive`: reads the step brief (title + task context) + the handoff artifact(s)
    of this step's DEPENDENCIES (not simply "the previous step" — a DAG step's real
    upstream producer is its `deps`, see `_read_handoff`). No deps ⇒ empty context.
  - `work`: one LLM call with the agent's persona/skills/company docs injected (same
    seam every report graph uses), producing the step's result text. `search_hook`
    is an injectable, OPTIONAL web-search callable — None (no-op, the default) when
    the caller has no real search wired in. Runs exactly ONCE per attempt. Before the
    work LLM call, an OPTIONAL consult hook (`deps.ask_colleague`, M33) may ask up to
    `MAX_CONSULTS` colleagues one question each — a synchronous role-play consultation
    over a colleague's `SOUL.md`/`PROJECT.md` FILES (`team_task_consult.ask_colleague`),
    deliberately NOT the sibling-memory system (see that module's docstring for why).
    `deps.ask_colleague is None` ⇒ no consult, byte-identical to pre-M33 behavior.
  - `self_check`: one structured LLM call grading `result_text` against the step's
    `acceptance` criteria (`team_steps.acceptance`, metadata — see
    `task_decomposition.decomposition_content_hash`'s docstring for why it is not part
    of the DAG hash). Binary `passed` + `failures` list + `confidence` — routing
    (`route_after_check`) uses ONLY `passed` + the rework counter, never `confidence`
    (kept for observability/logging only).
  - `rework`: re-runs the work LLM call with the ORIGINAL brief + the prior attempt's
    `result_text` + the self-check's structured `failures`, asking the model to fix
    ONLY the listed failures. Bumps `rework_count`. Capped at `max_rework` (2) —
    exhausted ⇒ `route_after_check` sends the LATEST result to `deliver` anyway with
    `self_check_failed=True` set (a stuck self-check must never block delivery
    forever; the CEO/room sees the flag instead).
  - `deliver`: writes the result to `step-<n>.json` (internal artifact — THE
    INVARIANT: no external write happens here) and returns a room-message payload
    (a short human-readable line the coordinator can post to the group chat). A step
    that itself needs an EXTERNAL write (e.g. "post this to Slack") does so through
    the normal per-agent `ActionGateway` via the optional `deps.external_write` hook,
    called from `deliver` BEFORE the internal artifact is written. If the gateway
    answers `pending_approval` (trust ladder / Lớp B queue — same contract as every
    other write path, see `action_gateway.GatewayResult`), `deliver` does NOT write
    the internal artifact yet and the graph reports `status: "awaiting_approval"` in
    its result instead of completing; the CALLER (`team_step_runner.run_team_step`)
    maps this to the worker's exit-3 / `awaiting_approval` step status.

No LangGraph checkpointer on this graph (`build_team_task_graph` compiles with
`checkpointer=None` — deliberate, see the module's design note below): each step's
graph run is a single in-process `.stream()` call, start to finish, within one
attempt. There is therefore no resumable in-flight state to restore mid-graph: the
coordinator ticker POLLS the step's stored `approval_id` against `ApprovalStore`
every tick (`coordinator_nodes.tick_actions.poll_awaiting_approval_step`) — once the
CEO resolves it out-of-band (`mpm approve`/`mpm reject`), the very next tick
re-reserves the SAME step (a FRESH `attempt_id`) and it re-runs
`perceive → work → self_check → ... → deliver` from scratch (approve) or marks it
`failed` + escalates (reject). Rework/self-check counters live only in this one
attempt's in-memory state (`total=False` TypedDict, primitives only) and are NOT
persisted across attempts — a retried step starts its rework budget fresh, matching
"retry = fresh attempt re-run" (there is no production caller that resumes the SAME
attempt_id mid-graph: every re-spawn mints a new one, `reserve_step`
`team_task_steps.py`). `deliver`'s external write MUST therefore be idempotent/
safe-to-retry from the gateway's own dedup, exactly like every other scheduled
report's external delivery.

State holds only primitives (checkpoint-safe shape, even though nothing is actually
checkpointed here), matching every other report graph's state discipline.

    saved one. The parameter stays (rather than being removed) only because
