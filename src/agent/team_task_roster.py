"""Shared "who can be assigned a team-task step" computation (v12 M28b).

One function, used at BOTH gates `task_decomposition.py`'s module docstring documents:
decompose-validation time (`ops_assign_team_task.preview_assign_team_task`, before the
CEO ever sees a preview) and dispatch time (the coordinator ticker, in case the
registry/roles changed between confirm and dispatch — see `coordinator_graph.py`).
Both call sites MUST agree on the same exclusion rules, or a step could pass one gate
and silently fail (or worse, silently pass) the other.

Excluded from the assignable roster, even though they are enabled registry agents:
  - the coordinator itself (`company.yaml::coordinator_id`) — it dispatches team-task
    steps, it does not execute them.
  - the admin agent (`domain == "admin"`) — the CEO's fleet-overseer/ops-chat agent,
    not a line worker; giving it a team-task step would let a CEO brief accidentally
    grant a team-task step the admin agent's config-write ops-chat privileges.
