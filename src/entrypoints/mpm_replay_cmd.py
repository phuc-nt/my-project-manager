"""`mpm agent replay <id> <thread> [--checkpoint <id>]` (v2 M3-P12 B3).

Read-only sibling of `mpm agent resume`. With no `--checkpoint`, LISTS the checkpoint
history for a thread so the operator can pick one. With `--checkpoint <id>`, replays the
thread from that saved checkpoint using the FROZEN stored state (no re-fetch of live
Jira/GitHub — replay-from-checkpoint, the KISS default; re-fetch is deferred).

Runs IN-PROCESS (replay is read-mostly, not a delivery spawn). The graph is built once via
`build_graph_for`, opening the agent's checkpointer a single time. Replay adds no new write
path: a replay reaching a write hits the SAME Action-Gateway chain as the original run.
