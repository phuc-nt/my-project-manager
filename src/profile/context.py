"""Profile context → prompt injection helpers (v2 M1-P2).

Carries the three Markdown strings a profile contributes to the LLM call and the
two tiny functions that fold them into the prompt seam:

- `persona` (SOUL.md)  → PREPENDED to the system message. For an external report the
  external system prompt's PII-sanitization stays the authoritative tail, so a
  persona that names people cannot override "omit keys/PR/names" (proven by the
  guardrail test in test_audience_prompts.py).
- `project` (PROJECT.md) + `memory` (MEMORY.md) → a labeled block prepended to the
  USER message — but only for INTERNAL reports. They carry internal facts
  (milestones, conventions, reviewer names, issue keys) a stakeholder summary must
  not ground on, so they are NOT injected on the external path.

Every field defaults to "", so an empty profile yields byte-identical v1 prompts.
