The single value that makes an agent isolated is its `data_dir`: every store
(audit / dedup / approvals / budget / checkpoints) keys off `settings.data_dir`

free — `ActionGateway`/`BudgetTracker`/the checkpointer need no change.

`thread_id` is prefixed with the agent id so two agents' checkpoint threads never
collide (v1 used a flat `report-<kind>-<audience>`).
