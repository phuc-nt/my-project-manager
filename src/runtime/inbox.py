"""Ask-agent Slack inbox poll (v3 M11). Generic — no domain knowledge.

The scheduler fires kind `inbox` every `poll_minutes` (profile `inbox:` block). One
poll: search the configured channel for NEW messages containing `@<agent-id>` (plain
text — browser-token Slack has no bot user to @-mention), answer each through
`qa_answer.answer_mention`, and advance a persisted ts watermark.

Why this cannot loop on itself (risk R1): replies are posted IN THREAD and never
contain the `@<agent-id>` phrase, so the search never matches the agent's own output;
the gateway dedup (keyed on the mention's immutable ts) additionally makes every
mention answerable at most once, across restarts.

Bootstrap: the first poll ever answers NOTHING — it just records the newest existing
ts as the watermark. An agent switched on at noon must not reply to a month of
backlog mentions.
