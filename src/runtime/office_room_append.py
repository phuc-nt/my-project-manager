"""try/degrade wrapper for `office_room_store.append` calls made from the team-task
pipeline (v12 M29): coordinator ticker, `ops_assign_team_task`, `team_step_runner`.

A room-store append is a NICE-TO-HAVE observability write, never a step in the pipeline
itself — the coordinator/step/CEO-command flow must complete identically whether or not
the append lands (a locked file, a disk-full data dir, or a bad `kind` must never block
dispatch/step-completion/task-confirm). Every call here therefore swallows its own
exception and logs, matching `team_tick_collaborators.make_escalate`'s "never raises"
contract for the exact same reason.
