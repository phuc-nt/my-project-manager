"""Group-chat room store — the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the office timeline (v12 M29).

Cross-agent SQLite at `data_dir` ROOT (mirrors `team_task_paths.py`'s pattern — a team
task/the office spans multiple agents, so its shared state cannot live inside one
agent's isolated `.data/agents/<id>/`). **No in-proc event bus**: the coordinator ticker,
each spawned `team-step` worker, and the admin ops agent are all SEPARATE OS processes,
so an in-proc asyncio bus in the web server's event loop would never see their writes —
this store (SQLite **WAL + busy_timeout**, `check_same_thread=False`) is the only
cross-process channel, exactly like `team_task_store.py`.

One row per event: `seq` (AUTOINCREMENT) is the monotonic total-order key — `ts` alone is
not enough for `since_seq` resume/dedup (two events in the same millisecond, clock skew
across processes). Rooms: one room per team task (`room_id = task_id`) plus one "office"
room that receives ONLY `milestone`-kind events (the CEO-facing overview room).

PII firewall AT WRITE TIME: `append` runs every event body through
`office_event_projection.summarize_office_event` BEFORE it is persisted — so the store
never holds an unprojected field and replaying old rows (a client opening the room late)
is exactly as safe as the live stream. `kind` must be one of `office_event_projection
.VALID_KINDS`; an unknown kind is rejected (ValueError) rather than silently stored with
an empty projected body, so a caller's typo is loud in tests/dev, not a silent data-loss.
