"""CEO-observability alert push (v8 M21). Runs as the `ops-alerts` pseudo-kind on the
admin agent — a fleet health tick that proactively DMs the CEO when an agent goes quiet
or starts failing, so a low-tech operator learns about a dead agent without opening a
dashboard.

Deterministic + CODE-only (no LLM): reuses `team_alerts` (the same bar the /api/team/alerts
panel shows) and pushes any NEW-today alert to the admin's `ops_operator_id` through the
Action Gateway — no new outbound path. Dedup is per (agent, alert-kind, local-date) via the
gateway's dedup store (persists across restart), so a still-failing agent is re-notified once
the next day, never twice the same day.

Residual (documented, red-team M6): this is itself an agent run dispatched by the service. If
the ADMIN agent or the service daemon is the thing that died, no alert fires — M21 catches a
NORMAL agent dying while service + admin stay healthy. A dead-man's-switch is a follow-up.
