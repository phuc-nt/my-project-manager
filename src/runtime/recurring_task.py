"""report-task + qa-task check logic (v6 M15b) — recurring work, no natural end.

Unlike a watch-task (M15a) which STOPS when its target closes, a report-task and a qa-task
are open-ended recurring work: "mỗi thứ 6 tổng hợp chi phí gửi tôi", "mỗi sáng: hôm nay ai
quá tải?". They have no "done" state of their own — they run each due tick until the
operator cancels them or the deadline passes (R1: nothing runs forever).

- report-task params: {"kind": <report kind>, "audience": "internal"}. Each run is the
  EXISTING report graph (build_graph_for → invoke) — same delivery, gateway, Lớp B as a
  scheduled report. The task just gives it its own cadence.
- qa-task params: {"question": <text>}. Each run is the M11 Q&A path against the pack's
  primary kind, the answer posted to the agent's channel.

Both cost LLM tokens (a report composes prose, a qa grounds+answers), so the runner tracks
cost per run — unlike watch-task which is a free CODE check.

`run_recurring` performs the whole run (READ + compose + POST through the gateway) and
returns (summary, cost). Deadline is decided by the runner (shared with watch) BEFORE
calling this, so here we only do the work.
