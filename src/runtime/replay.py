"""B3 run replay / time-travel (v2 M3-P12) — re-run a thread from a saved checkpoint.

Replay-from-checkpoint is the ONLY mode this round (KISS): it resumes a thread from the
FROZEN stored state at a checkpoint — it does NOT re-fetch live Jira/GitHub. Re-execute
(re-fetch) and time-travel state edits are deferred future toggles, intentionally not built.

Replay adds NO new write path: it re-runs an EXISTING compiled graph whose deliver node
already routes every mutation through the Action Gateway (Lớp A/B + dedup). A replay that
reaches a write hits the SAME guard chain as the original run — no bypass, no new authority.

`build_graph` is injected (like `worker_resume`) so tests run on a tmp SQLite checkpoint
with no live data.
