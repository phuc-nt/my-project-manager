"""Coordinating service daemon + scheduler (v2 M1-P3, D1).

A long-running process that reads `registry.yaml`, reads each agent's `schedule:`
(profile.yaml cron strings), and on a schedule spawns + supervises one per-agent worker
subprocess per due report — replacing v1's global launchd plists. An agent runs only
when BOTH its registry `enabled` and its profile `enabled` are true.

All scheduling logic is the pure `scheduler.due_reports`; this module adds the daemon
loop, the worker spawn, supervision (600s timeout + a concurrency cap), and outcome
collection. `spawn` is injectable so tests assert the exact worker argv with no real
process and a fixed clock — `run_forever` (the only timing-dependent part) is a thin
untested wrapper over the unit-tested `run_tick`.
