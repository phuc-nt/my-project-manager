"""Full-replan amendment drafts for `team_tasks` (v13 M34) — split out of
`team_task_store.py` to keep that module under the repo's ~200 LOC guideline, same
pattern as `team_task_steps.py`'s split (pure functions over a raw `sqlite3.Connection`,
`TeamTaskStore` delegates).

TOCTOU design:

  - A draft binds `base_plan_hash` = the task's FULL-DAG `plan_hash` AT DRAFT TIME
    (every row, not just the CEO-confirmed subset `_verify_plan_hash` recomputes) —
    this single comparison subsumes every one of: a completed-prefix step finishing
    between draft and confirm, a pending step getting dispatched (reserved -> running)
    in that window, a SECOND amend draft confirming first (amend-over-amend), and a
    ticker-inserted review/rework row landing in that window. ANY of those changes the
    persisted DAG, which changes `plan_hash` (see `task_decomposition
    .decomposition_content_hash` — computed identically over ALL persisted steps here,
    not the `system_inserted=0` subset `_verify_plan_hash` uses, because an amend must
    also catch a NEW review/rework row landing, which the confirmed-only hash would
    blind itself to).
  - SINGLE live draft per task: `set_amendment_draft` terminalizes any prior
    `draft`-status row for the same task before inserting the new one — a CEO who
    re-runs "chỉnh kế hoạch" before confirming the first draft gets exactly one
    confirmable draft, never two racing each other.
  - `confirm_amendment` CONSUMES the draft (status gate: only a row still `draft`
    status can confirm — mirrors `confirm_plan`'s `planning`-only gate) inside ONE
    `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction that ALSO re-validates `base_plan_hash` and swaps the
    pending steps — SQLite's single-writer serialization means this transaction and the
    ticker's own `reserve_step` UPDATE can never interleave mid-operation; whichever
    acquires the RESERVED lock first completes atomically before the other proceeds.
  - Draft TTL: `cleanup_stale_drafts` terminalizes (`status='expired'`) any `draft` row
    older than the caller's TTL — an abandoned draft (CEO asked for a replan, then
    never confirmed/cancelled) must not sit forever as a landmine a much-later,
    unrelated "xác nhận" could accidentally consume.
