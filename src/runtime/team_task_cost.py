"""Per-team-task cost cap enforcement (v12 M28b; DERIVED headroom v13 M34).

`TeamTaskStore.sum_cost` already adds step + decompose + aggregate cost (see its
docstring); this module is the one-line cap comparison the coordinator ticker calls
every tick before acting, so the cap check lives in ONE place rather than being
inlined at each of the ticker's several call sites.

**v13 update — the old v12 overshoot-bound clause below is now FALSE and superseded
by `spawn_headroom_usd`**: v12 said "a step is one bounded LLM call... worst-case
overshoot is bounded by one step's cost". Since M31–M33 a single step's own graph run
may make up to ~8 bounded LLM calls (perceive/work, self_check, ≤2 rework rounds each
re-running self_check, ≤2 consult questions, plus a peer-review step's own verdict
call) — still BOUNDED per step (the ≤2 counters are hard caps in graph state), but no
longer "one call". `check_cost_cap` (the HARD stop, checked once per tick before any
other action) is unaffected by this — it only ever sums cost already RECORDED in the
store, exactly as before.

**Parallel dispatch (v13 M34) — no reservation ledger, DERIVED headroom instead**:
concurrent steps mean more than one step can be in flight against the SAME cap at
once, so a naive "check cap, then spawn" ticker loop could rubber-stamp several steps
whose COMBINED (not yet recorded) cost blows the cap before any of their `mark_done`
writes land. The tempting fix — a reservation/ledger table the ticker writes to before
spawning and reconciles after — was rejected: a reservation has to
be released on EVERY exit path (done, failed, timeout, kill, crash, retry, the task
itself getting `stalled`/`cancelled` mid-flight) or it leaks headroom forever; missing
even one of those paths silently starves the task of spawnable steps. Instead,
`spawn_headroom_usd` DERIVES the in-flight reservation from the steps table itself —
`Σ(estimate over steps status='running')` — which is automatically correct on every
exit path because a step's status transition (to `done`/`failed`/`timeout`, or back to
`pending` via a fresh dead-pid retry reserve) is the SAME write that already has to
happen for that step's lifecycle; there is no separate row to leak or reconcile.
`awaiting_approval` is deliberately NOT counted as "in flight" here (mirrors
`coordinator_graph`'s lease-clock-paused treatment of that status) — a step paused on
a human decision releases its headroom back to the task while it waits, rather than
holding a slot hostage for however long the CEO takes to decide.
