"""Cross-agent path helpers for the team-task store + handoff artifacts.

Both the store DB and the handoff artifacts live at the repo-root `DATA_DIR`
(`.data/`), NOT under any single agent's `.data/agents/<id>/` — a team task spans
multiple agents by design, so its shared state cannot live inside one agent's
isolated dir. This is the single source of truth for that root path so the
coordinator, the worker's `team-step` branch, `team_task_store`, and
`team_task_artifact` never disagree on where the shared state lives.
