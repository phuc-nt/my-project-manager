"""Step-level SQL for the team-task store — split out of `team_task_store.py`
to keep each module under the repo's ~200 LOC guideline.

Pure functions over a raw `sqlite3.Connection` (no class): `TeamTaskStore` owns the
connection/schema/task-level API and delegates every `team_steps` row operation here.
Kept function-style (not a second class) because every call already takes the shared
connection as its first argument — a class would add no encapsulation, only ceremony.

Lease semantics (mirrors the store's docstring): `reserve_step` always claims (issues a
fresh `attempt_id`, marks `running`); the caller decides whether re-reserving an already-
`running` step is legitimate via `lease_expired` (lease-clock check only — the artifact-
absence half of the double-spawn guard is owned by the coordinator ticker, since only it
knows the artifact path convention).

Heartbeat owner: the WORKER refreshes `last_seen`/`lease_expires_at` at each of its own
graph node boundaries (perceive/work/deliver — see `team_step_runner.run_team_step`), so
a long-running-but-alive step's lease never goes stale mid-work. The ticker still kills
the pid and marks `timeout` unconditionally once a lease IS expired (it does not probe
"is the heartbeat merely late" — a missed heartbeat past the TTL is itself the timeout
signal), so double-spawn is prevented two ways: normally the heartbeat keeps the lease
alive so expiry never fires on live work; if it ever did anyway (e.g. a heartbeat write
lost a race), `set_step_status`'s optional `attempt_id` guard makes the ORIGINAL worker's
terminal write (`mark_done`/`mark_failed`) a no-op against the new attempt's row.
