"""`team-tick` generic run kind's real body (v12 M28b) — runs ONLY on the coordinator
agent (`company.yaml::coordinator_id`). Wires the pure `run_one_tick` (coordinator_graph)
with real collaborators: the shared `TeamTaskStore`, a JSON-sidecar `RetryTracker`, a
DETACHED `team-step` worker spawn (never waited on — that is the whole point of a SHORT
tick), `os.kill`-based pid probing, and (from `team_tick_collaborators`) an LLM aggregate
call + a Telegram escalation mirroring `ops_alert_runner.py`'s pattern (best-effort,
never raises).

Returns the same `{status, checked, cost_usd, delivered}` shape `run_tasks`/
`run_ops_alerts` return, so `worker.py`'s `team-tick` branch can reuse the identical
run-event plumbing as every other generic kind.
