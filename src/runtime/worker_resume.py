"""Worker `--resume` path (v2 M2-P5): resume a graph paused at a Lớp B interrupt.

    python -m src.runtime.worker --agent-id <id> --resume \
        --thread <thread_id> --decision approve|reject

The fresh run left the graph PAUSED at the `approval_gate` node with its state
checkpoint-serialized at `thread_id`. This re-attaches to that SAME thread on the
agent's per-agent checkpointer and resumes it with `Command(resume=decision)`:
approve → the graph routes to `deliver` and posts LIVE (gateway already-approved
path); reject → the graph routes to `END`, nothing posted, the decision is audited.

Resume reads the agent's configured checkpointer (SqliteSaver by default, or a
PostgresSaver when opted in via P8). With the SQLite default this is same-machine
resume; durable cross-process/cross-machine resume is the Postgres opt-in (P8). The
thread_id encodes `<agent_id>:<kind>:<audience>` so the SAME graph structure is
rebuilt — a resume must reconstruct the node/edge shape the checkpoint was created with.
