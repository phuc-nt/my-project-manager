"""NativeGraphRuntime (v20 Phase 1) — the existing graphs, behind the seam.

Delegates straight to the unchanged builders (`build_graph_for` for reports,
`build_team_task_graph` for team steps). No prompt/state layer is added, so a native agent's
output is byte-identical to pre-v20. This is the default backend and the fallback for the
kill-switch / None-degrade paths.
