"""Read-only toolset + policy shim for tool-calling runtimes (v20 Phase 2).

THE INVARIANT this file enforces (red-team C1/C2/H4):

- **Positive allowlist, never a denylist.** The loop is given an EXPLICIT list of read-only
  callables (mirrors `mpm_automate_cmd._build_read_tools`), not "every MCP tool minus the write
  allowlist" — the write allowlist is a positive permit-list of ~11 named writes, so its
  complement still contains destructive tools like `deletePage`/`deleteIssue`. Those must NEVER
  enter the toolset; here they simply are not listed.
- **Policy shim on every tool.** Each callable is wrapped so it runs `hard_block.classify`
  before doing anything. Even though the toolset is read-only by construction, the shim keeps
  the gateway's classify as the single policy chokepoint — a defense-in-depth so a future tool
  that slips in still cannot reach a side effect without being classified.
- **Audience-aware.** For an `external` audience run, internal-data read tools are withheld
  entirely, so a summarize step cannot fold internal content into an external deliverable.

The runtime that consumes this (`ToolCallingRuntime`) never binds raw MCP tools to the model;
it binds only what `build_read_toolset` returns.
