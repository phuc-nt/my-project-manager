"""Read-only view assembly for the agent routes (v2 M2-P6).

Pure data assembly over the existing per-agent primitives — the routers stay thin.
Everything keys off `agent_data_dir(id)` (same store the worker/mpm path uses), so the
views read the migrated per-agent budget / approvals / run-event log.

No graph is built and no LLM is called here, so these views need no API key and do no
network I/O beyond reading local per-agent files (+ profile.yaml / .env via load_profile).
