"""FastAPI app factory for the multi-agent web service (v2 M2-P6; auth added v6 M16).

SECURITY POSTURE: localhost dev runs with NO auth (byte-identical to pre-M16). For a real
deployment, set `WEB_AUTH_PASSWORD_HASH` + `WEB_SESSION_SECRET` (v6 M16) — then every route
except /health + login requires a signed session, and binding to a non-loopback host with
auth OFF is refused at startup (`auth.assert_bind_safe`). The per-agent guardrail (Lớp A/B +
audit + budget + dedup) applies regardless; auth protects the web's Lớp B approve surface.

`create_app()` builds the app; `app = create_app()` is the module-level ASGI target for
both `uvicorn src.server.app:app` and FastAPI's TestClient.
