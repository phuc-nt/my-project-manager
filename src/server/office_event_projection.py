"""Office room event projection — the PII firewall for `office_room_store` (v12 M29).

Same philosophy as `sse_events.summarize_node` (`src/server/sse_events.py:17`): project
a raw event body down to an ALLOWLIST of non-PII fields per `kind`. Anything not on the
allowlist is DROPPED. Unknown kind -> {} (drop all — a safe default if the room grows a
new kind before this module is updated).

Applied AT WRITE TIME by `office_room_store.append` (workers are the writers), NOT at
SSE emit time — so the store itself never holds an unprojected field, and replay (a late
subscriber reading old rows back out of the store) is automatically as safe as the live
stream. Free-form `body_json` passthrough is forbidden by construction: every kind here
lists its own short, explicit set of string/number fields.
