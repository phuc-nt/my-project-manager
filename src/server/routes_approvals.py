"""Lớp B approve/reject on the dashboard (v2 M2-P7 Slice 2).

HTML-partial / htmx-native: each route returns an HTML fragment that swaps in, never
JSON. Approve is a TWO-STEP flow — list → confirm partial (shows what will be posted)
→ confirm POST — so the operator sees exactly what goes live before the real Slack
post. Reject is one-click.

Approve does the SAME real-post path as the CLI: build the per-agent gateway, call
`gw.approve(id, handler=dispatch_approved_action)`. Lớp A hard-deny + audit + dedup
still apply. The gateway is built per request and CLOSED in a finally (no fd leak in
the long-lived server). The pending action is already redacted at enqueue, so rendering
it is safe.
