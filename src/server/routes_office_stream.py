"""Office room SSE — MULTI-SUBSCRIBER store-tail (v12 M29), NOT `stream_run`'s
single-drain (`src/server/run_manager.py`/`sse_stream.py`, untouched by this module).

`stream_run` refuses a second concurrent attach to a still-running run (409) because it
drains a single in-proc queue with exactly one live consumer. That model cannot serve
this room: the room's writers (coordinator ticker, step workers, admin ops agent) are
SEPARATE OS processes, so there is no in-proc queue to drain in the first place — the
only channel is `office_room_store` (SQLite). Each client here owns its OWN cursor
(`since_seq`) and polls the store independently; N clients on the same room never
contend, so there is no 409 to raise.

Resume: a reconnecting `EventSource` sends `Last-Event-ID` (the browser's own built-in
behavior) with the last `id` it saw; a fresh client may pass `?since_seq=`. Either way
`list(room_id, since_seq)` returns exactly the rows after that cursor — no replay of
already-seen rows, no gap (the store's `seq` is the total-order key, not `ts`).

Each poll runs a synchronous sqlite read (`OfficeRoomStore.list`) directly on the event
loop, not offloaded to a thread: accepted at CEO-scale traffic — WAL mode means readers
never block on the room's writers, the query is indexed on `(room_id, seq)`, and a
single read is sub-millisecond, so it does not starve other coroutines on the loop.
