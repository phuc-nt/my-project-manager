"""CEO chat-ops web endpoint (v6 M14b) — the web face of the ops dialogue.

The dashboard's Chat box POSTs a message here; this drives the SAME `handle_ops_message`
engine the Telegram DM path uses (M14a), against the SAME per-operator conversation store
under the admin agent's data dir. So a dialogue started in the browser and continued on
Telegram (or vice-versa) shares one draft — the conversation_key is the admin agent's
configured `ops_operator_id`, not the transport.

Posture: localhost, no-auth (unchanged until M16). There is no per-request operator
identity on the web (a browser has none), so the web IS the operator by construction —
the same trust level as the existing no-auth admin write routes (create/enable/delete).
When M16 adds auth, this route sits behind it like every other.

Only an admin-domain agent with an `ops_operator_id` configured can be chatted with; any
other agent returns 400 (nothing to administer through).

    The design is SINGLE admin ops agent: web keys the conversation store off this agent's

    if two admin agents shared an operator id, a draft started on web (stored under the
    first agent) would not be found by a Telegram mention landing on the second agent's
    worker (drafts diverge). So we pick the first-in-registry admin ops agent

    misconfiguration instead of letting cross-surface drafts silently split.
