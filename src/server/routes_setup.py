"""First-run Setup Wizard API (v7 M17) — the ONLY web path that writes secrets to .env.

This is the highest-risk surface in v7, so the guards are layered (red-team hardened):

1. **Not-configured only**: every endpoint 410 Gone once setup is complete. "Complete" is a
   DURABLE marker file `.setup-complete` — NOT merely `auth_enabled()`. If it were only the
   password hash, losing/rotating the hash (bad restore, manual edit) would re-open the
   wizard and let a local attacker seize the dashboard (red-team MAJOR-2). The flag is set at
   `finish` and never auto-cleared.
2. **Localhost only**: refuse a non-loopback client. We read `request.client.host` and do
   NOT trust `X-Forwarded-For` — setup must run directly on the box, not behind a proxy.
3. **Write-only**: status returns booleans (key set / not set), never a secret value.
4. **Key-name whitelist**: `env_writer` refuses any key outside the allow-list (env-injection
   guard). Passwords go through the dedicated `finish` path, not free-form env.

Writing .env does NOT take effect in the running process (`load_dotenv` doesn't override
os.environ; the session secret binds once at app build). So `finish` writes the auth keys +
the marker, then RESTARTS the web service — only after restart is auth live. There is no safe
hot-reload for the session secret (red-team MAJOR-1).
