"""OKR epic-progress fetch — compute each epic's progress from its child issues.

The running Jira MCP (v3.0.0) exposes no epic-progress / story-points tool, so
progress is computed in Python: query an epic's children via `enhancedSearchIssues`
(JQL ``parent = <EPIC>``, falling back to ``"Epic Link" = <EPIC>``), normalize
them with the existing `jira_read.parse_issue`, and take ``done / total``.

`compute_epic_progress` is pure (fixture-testable); the fetch functions are the
single Jira-touching entry the OKR analyzer (Slice B) consumes.
