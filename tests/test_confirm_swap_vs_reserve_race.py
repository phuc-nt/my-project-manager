"""`confirm_amendment` vs the ticker's `reserve_step`, forced interleave (v13 M34):
SQLite's single-writer serialization (`BEGIN IMMEDIATE`) is the actual concurrency
primitive here — two REAL connections to the same on-disk store, deterministically
interleaved via a background thread blocked on SQLite's own busy-lock (no sleeps, no
timing guesses): whichever transaction acquires the write lock first completes
atomically before the other can even start writing, so the outcome is always either
"confirm won, swap applied, the racing reserve blocked until commit and can act on the
POST-swap DAG" or "reserve won first, confirm's re-validate/swap sees the step already
running and rejects" — never a torn state (no orphaned running step outside team_steps,
no duplicate step row, no partial swap).
