"""RED LINE: office-pack's empty allowlist must mean default-deny, never "no
allowlist configured" (which would silently widen to the CORE default allowlist).

The coordinator (office-pack) performs no external write of its own — the two things
it does (update team_task_store rows, spawn a `team-step` worker subprocess) never
touch the Action Gateway — so `pack.yaml` declares `servers: []` and
`write_handlers.ALLOWLIST = {}` on purpose. The regression this guards against:
`mcp_allowlist=pack.allowlist or None` — in Python, `{} or None` evaluates to `None`,
and `classify(action, allowlist=None)` falls back to the wider CORE (PM) default
allowlist. An empty dict must therefore be threaded through AS an empty dict, never
coalesced away, or a step could smuggle a live MCP write through the coordinator's
"empty" allowlist and land on the PM default's permitted tools instead.
