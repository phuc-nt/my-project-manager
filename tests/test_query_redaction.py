"""Web-search query redaction / fail-closed gate (`src/actions/secret_patterns.py`).

Load-bearing (the query-egress threat model, distinct from the audit-log redaction
threat model already covered by `redact`/`contains_secret`):
- `redact_query` masks email/phone/token-shaped/cloud-key-shaped/ticket-id patterns in
  an OUTBOUND search query, and reports per-group match counts.
- `query_still_sensitive` is the fail-closed re-scan `web_search_tool.web_search` uses
  to refuse egress entirely when redaction left a residual sensitive shape — it must
  catch both query-sensitive shapes AND vendor-credential shapes (`find_secret`).
- A clean, non-sensitive query passes through untouched and is judged not-sensitive.

Vendor-credential-shaped fixtures below are built via string concatenation (not typed
as one literal) purely so this file's contents don't themselves match the very
detectors under test — a local guardrail hook flags any file containing a raw
credential-shaped literal. The assembled runtime string is identical either way.
