"""M3-P12 S2 (B3): run replay core — frozen-state replay, no live re-fetch.

Offline: a tiny graph backed by a tmp SqliteSaver, seeded once. Proves replay resumes
from the stored checkpoint state WITHOUT re-running the perceive/fetch node (the H×H
re-fetch risk), lists checkpoint history with non-PII summaries, and errors cleanly on
an unknown checkpoint.
