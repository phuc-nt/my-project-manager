"""End-to-end stale-artifact re-review: a content step re-runs to a NEW attempt AFTER
its review-step was already minted and locked to the OLD attempt's artifact — the
reviewer's own worker run (`review_graph.run_review_step`, dispatched through
`team_step_runner._run_review`) must refuse to grade the stale content (never call the
LLM against it, never write a verdict), and the ticker rule
(`review_insert.maybe_handle_review_done`, driven here through the real `run_one_tick`)
must re-mint a FRESH review-step at the same round instead of ever stalling the task on
a review that graded content nobody will see delivered.

The individual halves of this (stale-artifact detection inside `run_review_step`;
ticker re-mint given a `None` verdict) are already covered narrowly in
`test_review_graph.py`/`test_review_insert_rule.py`; this test proves the FULL path
end to end, including a genuine content-step re-run (a fresh `attempt_id` via
`reserve_step`, not a hand-constructed mismatch).
