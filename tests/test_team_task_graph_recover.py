"""The v14 blocked-step recovery loop: `work` fails → `recover` (one best-effort
consult about the blocker) → `work` retries once → success delivers / second failure
re-raises exactly like pre-v14.

Load-bearing:
- fail once → recover consults with the blocker in the brief → retry succeeds →
  deliver; costs from the failed pass's consult spend are NOT lost.
- fail twice → the second exception propagates (runner's mark_failed/escalate
  contract unchanged — `route_after_work` never sees an over-budget failure).
- success on the first pass → recover never runs, `work_error` stays empty
  (pre-v14 byte-identical path).
- consult off (hooks None) → recover still retries once (plain retry, transient
  errors are the common case) and the retry's failure is terminal.
- pre-work consult is SKIPPED on the retry pass (recover already asked the one
  targeted question — no budget double-burn).
