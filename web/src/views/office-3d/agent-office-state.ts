// Pure event → state-machine mapping shared by the 3D scene and the 2D fallback table
// (agent-status-table.tsx). Kept dependency-free (no r3f/Canvas) so it is unit-testable in
// plain jsdom, matching the "SSE-driven only" requirement: this is the single place that
// decides what "idle / assigned / working / done" means for an agent, derived ONLY from the
// office room's OfficeMessage stream (no polling, no local-only state).
//
// Desks are keyed by `assigned_to`, NEVER by `author`: the ticker authors a step's `started`
// event as "coordinator" (it is the one dispatching, not the one doing the work) — the
// assignee identity rides in the body's `assigned_to` field instead (see
// `tick_actions.reserve_and_spawn` / `team_step_runner._append_step_event`). Keying by author
// would create a phantom "coordinator" desk that never leaves "working" and would leave real
// agents' desks empty until their first `handoff`.
//
// Real backend status vocabulary (grep `tick_actions.py`/`team_step_runner.py`): a
// `step_status` event's `status` is only ever `started` (ticker, dispatch) or `failed` (worker,
// terminal); a completed step is signaled by the `handoff` KIND, not a `step_status` status
// value — there is no `completed`/`done`/`in_progress` status string in production.
