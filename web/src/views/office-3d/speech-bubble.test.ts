// SpeechBubble itself cannot render in jsdom (drei's <Html> requires a live Fiber/Canvas
// context — see office-unified.test.tsx's note on the same constraint), so this covers the
// piece of its logic that can be verified without a Canvas: the phase-tag vocabulary the
// 3D bubble is supposed to render must exactly match the backend's phase constants
// (team_task_graph.py's PHASE_WORK/PHASE_SELF_CHECK/PHASE_REWORK/PHASE_RECOVER). A regression here — the
// map going empty/renamed, or agent-desk.tsx failing to pass `phase` through to
// `<SpeechBubble>` at all — is the exact class of bug that left the 3D phase render dead
// (the map existed and was correct, but nothing fed it a value).
